## ABC Polymer

**The Regular Edition is not yet published but will be during next weeks**

### What is ABC Polymer ?

ABC Polymer stands for "Application BaseCode for Polymer". It makes it possible to start a project on a neat base using technologies such as NodeJS (*Express.JS, Socket.IO & Passport/JWToken*) and Polymer (*Polymer Starter Kit*). ABC is available in two editions : the *Express edition* and the *Regular edition*, both are completely open-source and their use depend on which architecture you want to build your project on.

### What does this edition contain ?
                  
The *Express edition* runs entierly under the *EXPRESS.JS* server which make it possible to use secured authentification (such as *Passport.JS*) while the *Regular edition* is for people who want to run their website under existant web servers (*MAMP, WAMP, ...*) and use tokens for the authentification system.

**Both editions have two versions : one using MongoDB and one using MySQL for the database.**

### And for the future... ?

* Securing the JWToken in order to publish the Regular edition
* Implement cool element examples such as neon-animations etc...
* Lot of cool stuff from your contributions !
