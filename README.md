## ABC Polymer

### What is ABC Polymer ?

ABC Polymer stands for "Application BaseCode for Polymer". It makes it possible to start a project on a neat base using technologies such as NodeJS (*Express.JS, Socket.IO & Passport/JWToken*) and Polymer (*Polymer Starter Kit*). ABC is available in two editions : the *Express edition* and the *Regular edition*, both are completely open-source and their use depend on which architecture you want to build your project on.

The *Express edition* runs entierly under the *EXPRESS.JS* server which make it possible to use secured authentification (such as *Passport.JS*) while the *Regular edition* is for people who want to run their website under existant web servers (*MAMP, WAMP, ...*) and use tokens for the authentification system.

**Both editions have two versions : one using MongoDB and one using MySQL for the database.**
