## ABC Polymer - Regular Edition

### What this edition contain ?
                  
The *Regular edition* is for people who want to run their website under existant web servers (*MAMP, WAMP, ...*) and use tokens for the authentification system.

The folder `backend` contain `abc-mongodb.js` and `abc-mysql.js` : choose the first one in order to connect yourself to a mongodb and the second one for an SQL database. 

### How to use it ? 

Clone the repo and choose which version you want to use (`abc-mongodb` for *mongodb* and `abc-mysql` for *mysql*). Edit the file in order to connect it to your database and that's it, you can launch it !

** * If you are using the SQL version, don't forget to import the SQL file located in the root folder * ** 

##### - Can I use the regular Polymer Starter Kit with Gulp ?

Of course ! Download and set up the latest Polymer Starter Kit and then replace the folder `app` with the content of this folder (`no-express`) !

### Security issue

The use of the **Regular Edition** is not recommended for security reasons. The whole authentification system is not secured enough to be used for critical applications. If you are seeking security, please use the **Express edition**. 

### What in the future ?

* Add timer security for the token (trying to improve it as much I can)
* Improve the code
* Approve your future pull requests :D
